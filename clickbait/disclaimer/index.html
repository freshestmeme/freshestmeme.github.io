    AdSense Program Policies</a></p>
<hr/>
<p><b>ClickBait</b> is a game that presents satire on the ubiquity of website
    monetization by pay-per-click advertisements. In order to create an immersive and realistic experience, Google
    AdSense is used, as it is one of the largest, most well-known, and most programmatically stable online advertising
    networks.</p>
<p>ClickBait is also an experiment in observing whether users would be willing to see ads when they are presented as a
    feature of the webpage. Specifically, ClickBait seeks to fundamentally integrate advertisements with its core game
    mechanic. Without encouraging users to follow advertisement links or otherwise generate ingenuine
    advertisement traffic, this is an attempt to expose users to more advertising content while upholding
    organic advertisment traffic and remaining an entertaining stand-alone service. Although profitability from this
    novel monetization scheme is desireable, ClickBait is grounded in being ethical and fun.</p>
<p>Therefore, ClickBait was develeped to closely follow the <b>Google AdSense Terms and Conditions</b> and <b>Google
    AdSense Program Policies</b>. In particular, despite its appearance and satirical elements (such as its presentation
    of "Click Farms" and visual cursor elements, ClickBait remains in compliance with the following terms:</p>
<ol>
    <li>"Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially,
        including manual methods."
    </li>
    <li>"Publishers may not ask others to click their ads or use deceptive implementation methods to obtain clicks. This
        includes, but is not limited to, offering compensation to users for viewing ads or performing searches,
        promising to raise money for third parties for such behavior or placing images next to individual ads."
    </li>
    <li>"Publishers are encouraged to experiment with a variety of placements and ad formats. However, AdSense code may
        not be placed in inappropriate places such as pop-ups, emails or software. Publishers must also adhere to the
        policies for each product used. Please see our ad placement policies article for more information."
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including
    manual methods.</h2>
<p>From the Google AdSense Program Policies: <i>"Clicks on Google ads must result from genuine user interest. Any method
    that artificially generates clicks or impressions on your Google ads is strictly prohibited. These prohibited
    methods include, but are not limited to, repeated manual clicks or impressions, automated click and impression
    generating tools and the use of robots or deceptive software. Please note that clicking your own ads for any reason
    is prohibited."</i></p>
<p><b>ClickBait makes no attempt to deceive users into clicking on advertisements.</b> Advertisements are clearly
    displayed at the top layer of the webpage. Although the satirical elements poke fun at the idea of "Click Farms,"
    <b>no element of the webpage generates artificial clicks or traffic.</b></p>
<h2>Publishers may not ask others to click their ads or use deceptive implementation methods to obtain clicks. This
    includes, but is not limited to, offering compensation to users for viewing ads or performing searches,
    promising to raise money for third parties for such behavior or placing images next to individual ads.</h2>
<p>From Google AdSense Program Policies: <i>In order to ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, publishers
    participating in the AdSense program may not:
    <ul>
        <li>Compensate users for viewing ads or performing searches, or promise compensation to a third party for such
            behavior.
        </li>
        <li>Encourage users to click the Google ads using phrases such as "click the ads", "support us", "visit these
            links" or other similar language.
        </li>
        <li>Direct user attention to the ads using arrows or other graphical gimmicks.</li>
        <li>Place misleading images alongside individual ads.</li>
        <li>Place ads in a floating box script.</li>
        <li>Format ads so that they become indistinguishable from other content on that page.</li>
        <li>Format site content so that it is difficult to distinguish it from ads.</li>
        <li>Place misleading labels above Google ad units. For instance, ads may be labelled "Sponsored Links" or
            "Advertisements", but not "Favorite Sites" or "Today's Top Offers".
        </li>
    </ul>
</i></p>
<p><b>ClickBait makes no attempt to encourage users to ingenuinely click on advertisements.</b> Ads are displayed
    automatically in their original form from the Google AdSense network. Users do not gain points or any other
    compensation from clicking on advertisements. They do, however, gain points from having more advertisements on the
    page; <b>but it is claimed that this does not unreasonably influence user behavior any differently than a
        traditional
        site with a similar numeber of advertisements would.</b></p>
<h2>Publishers are encouraged to experiment with a variety of placements and ad formats. However, AdSense code may
    not be placed in inappropriate places such as pop-ups, emails or software. Publishers must also adhere to the
    policies for each product used. Please see our ad placement policies article for more information.</h2>
<p>From Google AdSense Program Policies: <i>Google ads, search boxes or search results may not be:
    <ul>
        <li>Integrated into a software application (does not apply to AdMob) of any kind, including toolbars.</li>
        <li>Displayed in pop-ups or pop-unders.</li>
        <li>Placed inside emails, or on pages where email messages are the primary focus.</li>
        <li>Placed on pages where dynamically-generated content (such as live chat, instant messaging, or
            auto-refreshing comments) is the primary focus of the page.
        </li>
        <li>Obscured by elements on a page.</li>
        <li>Placed on any non-content-based page. (Does not apply to AdSense for search or mobile AdSense for search.)
        </li>
        <li>Placed on pages published specifically for the purpose of showing ads.</li>
        <li>Placed on pages whose content or URL could confuse users into thinking it is associated with Google due to
            the misuse of logos, trademarks or other brand features.
        </li>
        <li>Placed on, within or alongside other Google products or services in a manner that violates the policies of
            that product or service.
        </li>
    </ul>
</i></p>
<p>The content ClickBait claims to provide to the user is the experience of interacting with the webpage, that is,
    playing the game itself. Therefore, it is believed that ClickBait qualifies as a content-based page, only that
    the advertisements have a more integrated role than usually do on a more traditional website. <b>ClickBait,
        therefore, is not a page that was designed specifically for showing ads.</b></p>
<hr/>
<p>It is therefore believed that ClickBait is an in-good-faith effort to create an entertaining game that pokes fun at
    advertising while making fair and positive use of the advertising platform. For further clarification on the intent
    of ClickBait and for correspondence on the use of Google AdSense, please do not hesitate to contact the publisher at
    the email connected to the AdSense account.</p>
